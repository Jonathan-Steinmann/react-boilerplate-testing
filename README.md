<div align="left">This project is a testing ground to learn / work with React.js, Redux, Babel, redux-saga, react-router, Offline First, etc.</div>

## Quick start

1. Clone this repo using `git clone https://github.com/Jonathan-Steinmann/react-boilerplate-testing.git`
2. Move to the appropriate directory: `cd react-boilerplate-testing`.<br />
3. Run `npm run setup` in order to install dependencies and clean the git repo.<br />
   *We auto-detect `yarn` for installing packages by default, if you wish to force `npm` usage do: `USE_YARN=false npm run setup`*<br />
   *At this point you can run `npm start` to see the example app at `http://localhost:3000`.*
4. For learning purposes, I recommend looking at the example app.
5. Run `npm run clean` to delete the example app once you're ready to start your own project.  

Now you're ready to rumble!
